        <p>Italy is one of the world's top tourist destinations, offering everything you need for a fun vacation. Italy symbolizes everything you can imagine in a beautiful life. Italy is characterized by beautiful landscapes alongside large, magnificent and spectacular cities and picturesque villages. I will bring you here some recommended places you can go and enjoy as much as possible in this wonderful place.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rome and Lazio:</strong> The capital of Italy, Rome, lies in the Lazio region. The city, is one of the most beautiful cities in Europe.The amount of historical sites in it is huge and some of them are of exceptional importance. The Coliseum, Titus Gate and the Pantheon are some of the evidence of the region's magnificent history and the Vatican and other Rome museums curate artwork.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Venice:</strong> The city of Venice, considered one of the most beautiful cities in the world, is the capital of the Veneto region in northern Italy. It is a top destination for tourists visiting Italy and some say they should be favored over a visit to Rome, if they are forced to choose. Romantic Venice is famous for its gondolas, traversed by gondolas, in the San Marco Basilica, which stands in a square bearing the same name and in museums, featuring the works of the great Italian artists.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Aosta Valley:</strong>Its landscapes are very similar to those of neighboring Switzerland, with mountains whose peaks are snowed year-round. Here are the four highest peaks in the Alps, including the Monte Bianco. The Aosta Valley is a wonderful area for mountaineers, Walking lovers and anyone who loves beautiful scenery. The area is dotted with traditional villages and picturesque ski towns.</li><br>

        <h6>Posted on 1.4.2020</h6>
        <p>Lovers of entertainment will enjoy the city of Berlin, which is one of the leading nightlife capitals in the world and the supply of restaurants in it is also very plentiful. Israelis and Jews visiting the city will find great interest in many sites, related to the glorious community life, which has lived there for generations and the difficult events that plagued it with the rise of the Nazis to power.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>East Side Gallery:</strong>Lovers of art and history can tour the colorful gallery, which is open-air and features graffiti paintings painted on the last remnant of the Berlin Wall, which is over a kilometer long. Over a hundred colorful paintings, some very impressive, are drawn on the section of the wall, which was previously divided between communist East Berlin and West Berlin and testifies to the complex history of Germany at that time.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Tiergarten Park:</strong>Tirgarten Park, is a great place to spend a sunny, warm afternoon. It is the most popular park among Berliners, who come to it to do sports and just to lawn. If you want to get out of the city life and enjoy the quiet of the countryside, grass, streams and beer gardens in the park, will satisfy your needs.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Haksha Market:</strong>The market area is rich in street art galleries and art, especially on Auguststrasse Street and the surrounding streets. Visiting the area is like visiting an open museum. The interior of the Haksha Hoppe is considered one of the city's most prominent recreation areas and is filled with restaurants, bars and unusual design shops.</li>
        </ul>
      
      <p> My experience from Berlin is a calm experience, full of knowledge and very comfortable. If you are looking for a place to rest, this can be a great option.</p>
